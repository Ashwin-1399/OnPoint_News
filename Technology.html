            <p>Apple is rolling out various features to its AirTags that are set to help prevent unwarranted tracking, according to reports. 
			Apple introduced AirTags earlier this year, and cited privacy and security as core features of the device. However, there were 
			legitimate concerns regarding the location tags tracking people without them realising it.
			According to CNET, the company has confirmed that it’s adjusting its approach to its AirTags sensors and will change the time it takes for
			AirTags to play an alert after it is separated from its owner.</p>

            <h2>WhatsApp Fast Playback for voice messages: What it is and how to use it</h2>
            <p>WhatsApp introduced a new feature that lets users choose between multiple playback speeds while playing an audio file.
				The new options let you listen to longer voice messages easily and can also be used to skip through large messages to get to a particular point.
               This helps make the most of long voice messages, where it can sometimes be time-consuming to go through the entire message without skipping 
			   on any details. The latest WhatsApp update for Android and iOS changes that with the introduction of WhatsApp’s new  Fast Playback speeds.
			   There are two new playback speeds offered in the feature, taking the number of playable speeds to three.&nbsp;

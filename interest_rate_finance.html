                <b>U.S.</b>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that President Joe Biden’s $4 trillion spending proposal would be positive for the country, even if it leads to a rise in interest rates.</p>
                <p>During an interview with Bloomberg News, the former Federal Reserve chair said the president’s plans would total about $400 billion each year — a level of spending she argued was not enough to create an inflation over-run.</p>
				<p>“If we ended up with a slightly higher interest rate environment it would actually be a plus for society’s point of view and the Fed’s point of view,” Yellen told Bloomberg.</p>
                <p> “We’ve been fighting inflation that’s too low and interest rates that are too low now for a decade,” she said. She added that if the packages help at all to “alleviate things then that’s not a bad thing — that’s a good thing.”</p>
                <p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said President Joe Biden should push forward with his $4 trillion spending plans even if they trigger inflation that persists into next year and higher interest rates.</p>
                <p>The debate around inflation has intensified in recent months, between those like Yellen who argue that current price increases are being driven by transitory anomalies created by the pandemic -- such as supply-chain bottlenecks and a surge in spending as economies reopen -- and critics who say trillions in government aid could fuel a lasting spike in costs. </p>
                <p>Biden’s packages would add up to roughly $400 billion in spending per year, Yellen said, contending that’s not enough to cause an inflation over-run. Any “spurt” in prices resulting from the rescue package will fade away next year, she said.</p>
                <p>  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers held a phone call on May 28 in which the group pressed Yellen on her views on inflation, according to a Treasury official. The group ultimately agreed with her assessment that price spikes through the year are likely to be transitory, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>
                <p> Yellen said that monetary policy makers can handle any potential rise in inflation if it sticks. </p>

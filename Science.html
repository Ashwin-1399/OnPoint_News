            <p>Researchers at Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) have identified a protein-based pathway, used by hydra – a primitive organism –
			which could potentially hold some clues in understanding evolution of organisms and pointing towards specific genes that help the
			organisms survive very long. DNA  determines its growth, functionality and life,faces constant threat of getting damaged like chemicals, pollutants, ultraviolet rays 
			present in sunlight and other sources</p>
